**Domain:** Embedded Systems
**Duration:** 4 Weeks
**Mentor:** NEELA SANTOSH

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **voice-controlled home automation system** using Arduino Uno, a Bluetooth module (HC-06), and an Android mobile app developed in MIT App Inventor. It allows users to control household appliances such as motors and LEDs through voice commands, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

As part of a 4-week internship, the system shows the integration of **Bluetooth communication**, **voice recognition**, and **embedded hardware**, providing a practical example of smart home automation.

## Objectives

* Develop a voice-controlled system to operate household appliances.
* Interface HC-06 Bluetooth with Arduino Uno.
* Use MIT App Inventor to build a mobile app for voice command input.
* Simulate hardware operations using Proteus.
* Enhance understanding of embedded communication systems.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **IDE:** Arduino IDE
* **Simulation:** Proteus Design Suite
* **App Builder:** MIT App Inventor
* **Programming Language:** Embedded C
* **Hardware Components:**

  * Arduino Uno
  * HC-06 Bluetooth Module
  * Yellow LED
  * DC Motor
  * Resistor
  * Android Smartphone

##  Working Principle

1. The user gives a voice command via the Android app.
2. The app converts speech to text and sends the command to Arduino via Bluetooth.
3. Arduino receives the command and performs the corresponding action:

   * e.g., “Turn ON Light” turns on the LED.
   * e.g., “Turn OFF Fan” stops the DC motor.
4. Proteus simulation is used to test and visualize output.
